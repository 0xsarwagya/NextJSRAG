## Why We Created the Next.js RAG Demo

At [Rebackk](https://rebackk.xyz), our focus is on delivering robust cybersecurity products tailored to the needs of startups. We’re always exploring cutting-edge technologies to enhance our offerings, but our core mission remains centered around building practical, effective security tools. In developing our product, Sentinel (Coming Soon), we looked for ways to make vulnerability detection and response faster and more efficient. While we are primarily a security SaaS provider, we occasionally use technologies like AI and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKProofs) to enhance our products. That’s where the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) came into play for us.

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that boosts AI’s capabilities by allowing it to access real-time data. Instead of generating responses solely from pre-trained models, RAG pulls in current, relevant information. For Sentinel, this means more accurate vulnerability reports and quicker response times, giving our users real-time insights they can act on immediately.

### Why We Built the Demo

We built an RAG system for Sentinel to help developers with fixing vulnerabilities that we found on their webapps and APIs. We Thought it would be a good idea to show the power of RAG to the world by creating a demo that can be used by anyone to generate responses to questions. We hope that this demo will help developers understand the potential of RAG and inspire them to use it in their projects.

### For the Community, By Rebackk

At Rebackk, we believe in sharing what we learn. Our products are built to empower startups with affordable, high-quality cybersecurity solutions, and we want to extend that ethos to the broader developer community. By open-sourcing this demo, we aim to provide a tool that others can use, adapt, and extend in ways that suit their needs, whether it’s for enhancing security tools, improving user interactions, or automating workflows.


We’re releasing this to foster collaboration. Whether you’re a startup or an individual developer, we want to provide a tool that helps you enhance your projects with the latest tech.

### Why Open Source?

We open-sourced this project because we believe that sharing knowledge helps everyone. Even though this demo supports Sentinel’s capabilities, its potential goes beyond our immediate use. We hope that other developers can use this foundation to build their own solutions and improve security, automation, or customer-facing tools.

### What’s Next?

We’re excited to continue improving our products and sharing new developments with the community. While our core focus will always be on delivering reliable cybersecurity products, we’ll keep exploring ways that other deep tech can enhance our offerings. We hope that this demo will inspire others to experiment with RAG and other cutting-edge technologies, and we look forward to seeing what the community creates with it.
